# 🌱 Climate-Aware Crop Localization Platform

**Hackathon Project | Climate Hack 2025**  
*By Jacky Chen Xu, Ph.D.*

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project builds a data-driven platform to help localize the production of imported crops by identifying suitable regions for cultivation using climate, soil, and land use data.

## 🌍 Why This Matters

- 🌾 Food Security
- 💸 Cost Efficiency
- 📊 Data-Driven Planning
- 🌱 Sustainability

## 📊 Data Sources

See [docs/dataset_links.md](docs/dataset_links.md) for full dataset list with links.

## 🧠 Core Methodology

1. Crop Environmental Profiling
2. Suitability Analysis
3. Business-Driven Mapping
4. Cost Comparison

## 💼 Commercialization Strategy

Connecting small businesses (restaurants, tea houses, etc.) with domestic crop opportunities, creating a pull-based incentive model for farmers. Target outreach includes chambers of commerce and restaurant alliances.

## 💻 Technologies

- Google Earth Engine
- Python/R
- QGIS / ArcGIS
- Streamlit or React (planned)
- Jupyter Notebooks

## ✅ Hackathon Goals

- [x] Ideation
- [ ] Dataset integration
